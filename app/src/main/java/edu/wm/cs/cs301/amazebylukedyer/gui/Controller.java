/**
 * Class handles the user interaction. 
 * It implements an automaton with states for the different stages of the game.
 * It has state-dependent behavior that controls the display and reacts to key board input from a user. 
 * At this point user keyboard input is first dealt with a key listener (SimpleKeyListener)
 * and then handed over to a Controller object by way of the keyDown method.
 *
 * The class is part of a state pattern. It has a state object to implement
 * state-dependent behavior.
 * The automaton currently has 4 states.
 * StateTitle: the starting state where the user can pick the skill-level
 * StateGenerating: the state in which the factory computes the maze to play
 * and the screen shows a progress bar.
 * StatePlaying: the state in which the user plays the game and
 * the screen shows the first person view and the map view.
 * StateWinning: the finish screen that shows the winning message.
 * The class provides a specific method for each possible state transition,
 * for example switchFromTitleToGenerating contains code to start the maze
 * generation.
